## 🎄 Day 7: Laboratories

A tachyon beam enters a grid at S, moving downward through empty cells. When it hits a splitter (^), it splits into new beams to the left and right.

### Part 1

Simulate the beam flow and count the total number of splits.

### Part 2

Each split creates a new timeline. Count how many distinct timelines the tachyon particle occupies once it exits the grid.
